## What Yuxi Can Do

Yuxi is built for teams that need control over their data, models, and permissions:

- **Build knowledge-based Q&A**: Upload documents, parse and chunk them, build vector indexes, and let agents answer questions using retrieved content.
- **Execute multi-step tasks**: Combine tools, MCP, Skills, sub-agents, and sandboxes to produce previewable, downloadable files.
- **Connect knowledge graphs**: Extract entities and relationships from document chunks in Milvus knowledge bases, store them in Neo4j, and use them in retrieval.
- **Manage team access**: Control access to knowledge bases, agents, Skills, and models by user, department, and sharing scope.
- **Compare execution quality**: Evaluate knowledge base retrieval results, or use Langfuse Datasets to evaluate complete agent tasks.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vue 3 · Vite · Ant Design · G6 |
| Backend | FastAPI · LangGraph · ARQ worker |
| Storage | PostgreSQL · Redis · MinIO · Milvus · Neo4j |
| Document processing | MinerU · PaddleX · RapidOCR |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose, and have a working LLM API available. The repository's default configuration targets `v0.7.3`.

### 1. Get the Code and Initialize

```bash
git clone --branch v0.7.3 --depth 1 https://github.com/xerrors/Yuxi.git
cd Yuxi

# Linux/macOS
./scripts/init.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\init.ps1
```

The initialization script creates `.env`, prompts for a SiliconFlow API Key, and generates separate security keys for JWT, API Key derivation, and the Sandbox provisioner. You can also copy `.env.template` and fill in these values manually.

### 2. Start the Development Environment

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Check service status:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl --fail http://localhost:5050/api/system/ready
```

Once the returned `status` is `ready`, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), follow the page instructions to initialize the superadmin account, and sign in. API documentation is available at [http://localhost:5050/docs](http://localhost:5050/docs).

When upgrading from v0.7.1 or v0.7.2 to the current version, do not run `docker compose up` directly. Read the [production deployment and upgrade guide](docs/advanced/deployment.md) first, and complete the backup and migration during a maintenance window.

<details>
<summary><strong>More screenshots: conversations, execution status, and human approval</strong></summary>

**Long-running task status and execution tracking**

While complex tasks run asynchronously in the background, the interface shows the agent's reasoning progress, plans, subtask status, and tool logs in real time, making long-running work visible rather than leaving users waiting without feedback.

![Long-running task tracking](https://xerrors.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/github/image-20260826195730155.png)

**Human approval and delivery cards**

For critical operations such as modifying files or calling high-risk external APIs, the system displays a confirmation card and waits for human approval. When a task finishes, it summarizes the results and provides interactive access to deliverables.

![Human approval and file delivery](https://xerrors.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/github/image-20260825163940350.png)

</details>

### 02 · Knowledge Bases and RAG

Manage team materials centrally and parse them into structured knowledge bases. Agents can retrieve relevant document chunks as context for answering questions.

- Manage files and directories centrally, with live parsing progress, chunk details, and token statistics.
- Configure Embedding and Rerank algorithms, and test and tune multiple retrieval paths directly in the management interface.
- Use built-in RAG evaluation tools and real Q&A datasets to measure retrieval and answer quality.

### 04 · Multi-Agent Execution and Extensions

Combine models, prompts, knowledge bases, external tools, and specialized sub-agents in a single agent. For complex tasks, the main agent plans and delegates work while multiple SubAgents execute asynchronously in parallel. Skills and MCP provide additional capabilities.

- Configure the agent's base model, connected knowledge bases, tool access, and system prompt.
- Run multiple SubAgents asynchronously in parallel for deep research, data analysis, or content generation.
- Use native support for Skills extensions and MCP (Model Context Protocol).

![Yuxi multi-agent orchestration](https://xerrors.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/github/image-20260825152252874.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>More screenshots: agent configuration, sub-agents, and extensions</strong></summary>

**Agent configuration and behavior customization**

Modular configuration lets you combine models, knowledge bases, custom Tools, MCP services, initial prompts, and sub-agents. Configure sharing visibility within departments or teams as needed.

![Agent configuration](https://xerrors.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/github/image-20260825151729055.png)

**Parallel sub-agent execution**

The main agent can break a complex, multi-step task into independent assignments and dispatch specialized SubAgents in parallel—for example, researching regulations in different domains or writing separate report chapters. Their results are collected and summarized when they finish.

![Parallel sub-agent execution](https://xerrors.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/github/image-20260825151559976.png)
